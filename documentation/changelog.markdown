# Release 1.0 (February 20, 2012)

## Release Notes

This release contains changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot
versions. `CPTPlotRange` has been split into mutable and immutable variants similar to
`CPTLineStyle` and `CPTTextStyle`. This change will break existing code that changes plot
ranges; that code should be updated to use the mutable versions. The `CPTBarPlotField`
enum was changed so that the field values start at zero like all other plots. This will
affect any existing code that used hard-coded values for the fields instead of the enum
field names (`CPTBarPlotFieldBarLocation`, etc.). The `CPTNewCGColorFromNSColor()`
function was renamed to `CPTCreateCGColorFromNSColor()` to conform to Apple's memory
management naming conventions.

Core Plot now supports projects that use automatic reference counting (ARC). For
compatibility with older systems, Core Plot itself does not use ARC but its header files
and binaries can be used in applications that do.

## Details
- **New**: Added a script to automatically format the code following the coding standards using uncrustify.
- **New**: Added support for automatic reference counting (ARC).
- **New**: Added the HTML docs built with Doxygen to the source code repository so that they can be viewed online with a web browser.
- **New**: Added an `identifier` property to `CPTLayer`, replacing the one from `CPTPlot` and `CPTPlotGroup`.
- **New**: Added control chart and multi-colored bar plot examples to the Plot Gallery app.
- **New**: Added a mouse zoom user interface to the DropPlot app.
- **Changed**: Split `CPTPlotRange` into mutable and immutable variants.
- **Changed**: Changed the `CPTBarPlotField` enum values.
- **Changed**: Renamed the `CPTNewCGColorFromNSColor()` function to `CPTCreateCGColorFromNSColor()`.
- **Changed**: Updated all projects to support Xcode 4.2.
- **Changed**: Made all `CPTAxis` delegate methods optional.
- **Changed**: Added the `-[CPTAxis axis:shouldUpdateMinorAxisLabelsAtLocations:]` delegate method.
- **Changed**: Added a graph fill to the Slate theme so that all themes have explicit fills.
- **Changed**: Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanup.
- **Removed**: Removed unused `NSException` extensions.
- **Removed**: Removed unused methods from `CPTLayer` and `CPTTextLayer`.



# Release 0.9 Beta (September 25, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release contains several changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot
versions. The MacOS hosting view has been renamed and many deprecated properties and
methods have been removed. The axis constraints system has been changed; the new
class-based system is easier to set up and less prone to problems than the old
struct-based system. This release also adds support for many new features including hi-dpi
displays on MacOS, @2x images on both iOS and MacOS, shadows on many plot elements, arrows
and other line caps on axis lines, and animation support for many plot properties.

# Release 0.4 Alpha (July 7, 2011)

versions. The class prefix for all Core Plot classes and public symbols changed from

types. `CPTextStyle` and `CPLineStyle` have been split into mutable and immutable
variants similar to Cocoa's string, data, and collection classes. This change will break
existing code that changes text style and line style properties; that code should be
updated to use the mutable versions.
