/*! @mainpage Core Plot
 *
 *  @section intro Introduction
 *
 *  Core Plot is a plotting framework for Mac OS X and iOS. It provides 2D visualization of data,
 *  and is tightly integrated with Apple technologies like Core Animation, Core Data, and Cocoa Bindings.
 *
 *  @section start Getting Started
 *
 *  See the project wiki at
 *  http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/wiki/UsingCorePlotInApplications for information on how to use Core Plot
 *  in your own application.
 *
 *  @section contribute Contributing to Core Plot
 *
 *  Core Plot is an open source project. The project home page is http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/ on Google Code.
 *  See http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/source/checkout for instructions on how to download the source code.
 *
 *  @subsection coding Coding Standards
 *  Everyone has a their own preferred coding style, and no one way can be considered right. Nonetheless, in a
 *  project like Core Plot, with many developers contributing, it is worthwhile defining a set of basic coding
 *  standards to prevent a mishmash of different styles which can become frustrating when
 *  navigating the code base. See the file <code>"Coding Style.markdown"</code> found in the <code>documentation</code> directory
 *  of the project source for specific guidelines.
 *
 *  @subsection documentation Documentation Policy
 *  See http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/wiki/DocumentationPolicy for instructions on how to
 *  document your code so that your comments will appear in these documentation pages.
 *
 *  @subsection testing Testing Policy
 *  Because Core Plot is intended to be used in scientific, financial, and other domains where correctness is paramount,
 *  unit testing is integrated into the framework. Good test coverage protects developers from introducing accidental
 *  regressions and frees them to experiment and refactor without fear of breaking things. See
 *  http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/wiki/CorePlotTesting for instructions on how to build unit tests
 *  for any new code you add to the project.
