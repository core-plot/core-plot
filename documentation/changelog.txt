# Next Release

## Release Notes

## Details
- **New**: Added Bezier curve interpolation option to `CPTScatterPlot`.
- **New**: Added printing support to the OS X hosting view.
- **New**: Added a plot data label selection delegate method.
- **New**: Added a line fill property to `CPTLineStyle`.
- **Changed**: Changed the superclass of `CPTTextLayer` from `CPTLayer` to `CPTBorderedLayer`.



# Release 1.0 (February 20, 2012)

## Release Notes

This release contains changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot versions. `CPTPlotRange` has been split into mutable and immutable variants similar to `CPTLineStyle` and `CPTTextStyle`. This change will break existing code that changes plot ranges; that code should be updated to use the mutable versions. The `CPTBarPlotField` enum was changed so that the field values start at zero like all other plots. This will affect any existing code that used hard-coded values for the fields instead of the enum field names (`CPTBarPlotFieldBarLocation`, etc.). The `CPTNewCGColorFromNSColor()` function was renamed to `CPTCreateCGColorFromNSColor()` to conform to Apple's memory management naming conventions.

Core Plot now supports projects that use automatic reference counting (ARC). For compatibility with older systems, Core Plot itself does not use ARC but its header files and binaries can be used in applications that do.

## Details
- **New**: Added a script to automatically format the code following the coding standards using uncrustify.
- **New**: Added support for automatic reference counting (ARC).
- **New**: Added the HTML docs built with Doxygen to the source code repository so that they can be viewed online with a web browser.
- **New**: Added an `identifier` property to `CPTLayer`, replacing the one from `CPTPlot` and `CPTPlotGroup`.
- **New**: Added control chart and multi-colored bar plot examples to the Plot Gallery app.
- **New**: Added a mouse zoom user interface to the DropPlot app.
- **Changed**: Split `CPTPlotRange` into mutable and immutable variants.
- **Changed**: Changed the `CPTBarPlotField` enum values.
- **Changed**: Renamed the `CPTNewCGColorFromNSColor()` function to `CPTCreateCGColorFromNSColor()`.
- **Changed**: Updated all projects to support Xcode 4.2.
- **Changed**: Made all `CPTAxis` delegate methods optional.
- **Changed**: Added the `-[CPTAxis axis:shouldUpdateMinorAxisLabelsAtLocations:]` delegate method.
- **Changed**: Added a graph fill to the Slate theme so that all themes have explicit fills.
- **Changed**: Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanup.
- **Removed**: Removed unused `NSException` extensions.
- **Removed**: Removed unused methods from `CPTLayer` and `CPTTextLayer`.



# Release 0.9 Beta (September 25, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release contains several changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot versions. The MacOS hosting view has been renamed and many deprecated properties and methods have been removed. The axis constraints system has been changed; the new class-based system is easier to set up and less prone to problems than the old struct-based system. This release also adds support for many new features including hi-dpi displays on MacOS, @2x images on both iOS and MacOS, shadows on many plot elements, arrows and other line caps on axis lines, and animation support for many plot properties.

## Details

- **Changed**: Made plot point pixel alignment optional.
- **Changed**: Made the header files for several internal classes private.
- **Changed**: Performance enhancements in several plots and `CPTXYAxis`.

- **Removed**: Removed the unused default z-position from all layers.



# Release 0.4 Alpha (July 7, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release contains several changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot versions. The class prefix for all Core Plot classes and public symbols changed from "CP" to "CPT". Also, the iOS SDK is no longer supported. iOS projects that were built against the SDK must be updated to include the Core Plot project file or link against the new universal static library instead. 

## Details

- **New**: Added iOS universal static library build target.
- **New**: Added graph legends.
- **New**: Implemented logarithmic plot scales.
- **New**: Added support for multi-line text in `CPTTextLayer`.

# Release 0.3 Alpha (May 4, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release adds a new plot type (range plots) and adds features to several other plot types. `CPTextStyle` and `CPLineStyle` have been split into mutable and immutable variants similar to Cocoa's string, data, and collection classes. This change will break existing code that changes text style and line style properties; that code should be updated to use the mutable versions.

## Details

- **New**: Added an option in `CPBarPlot` to set bar widths in data or view coordinates.
- **New**: Added the `allowPinchScaling` property to `CPGraphHostingView`.
- **New**: Added a shared cache of common values to the `NSDecimal` conversion utility functions for performance.
